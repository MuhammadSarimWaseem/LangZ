# LangX

## Project Description

This project is made using Python and utilizes regular expressions (regex) to implement LangZ, a custom programming language. The language includes features such as variable declarations, initializations, and a for loop.

## Features
- Variable declaration: Easily declare variables in LangZ.
- Variable initialization: Initialize variables with values.
- For loop: Execute repetitive tasks using the custom for loopÂ implementation.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure that you have Python installed. Follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MuhammadSarimWaseem/LangZ.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd LangZ
    ```

## Examples

### Here are a few examples of LangZ code

#### Variable Declaration

    'num x'
    'decimal y'
    'letter z'

#### Variable Initialization

    num a = 5
    letter b = "f"
    decimal c = 9.8 

#### For loop

    for (num i = 1, i > 4, i++)
